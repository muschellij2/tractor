<h1>Getting started</h1>

<p>TractoR can be downloaded directly from <a href="downloads.html">this web site</a>, or else cloned from <a href="https://github.com/tractor/tractor/">GitHub</a> using <code>git</code>. This page outlines the process of installing the package on different platforms.</p>

<h2 id="system-requirements">System requirements</h2>

<p>In its basic form, TractoR is a set of packages written for the <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R language and environment</a>. R (version 3.0.0 or later) is therefore an absolute prerequisite. R is an open-source package that is easy to install. Precompiled binaries are available from a number of <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">CRAN mirror sites</a>, along with the source code.</p>

<p>A C/C++ compiler, such as <code>gcc</code>/<code>g++</code> or <code>clang</code>/<code>clang++</code>, is also required to install TractoR, although R handles all the details of actually compiling code.</p>

<h2 id="installation-on-linux">Installation on Linux</h2>

<p>Firstly, ensure that R and a C/C++ compiler are installed. It should be possible to do this using your distribution&rsquo;s package manager (<code>aptitude</code>, <code>yum</code>, etc.). For example, on Ubuntu,</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get install r-base-dev
</code></pre>

<p>should install everything required to build R packages. More specific information for various Linux distributions is available from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/">CRAN</a>.</p>

<p>After <a href="downloads.html">downloading the TractoR tarball</a>, installing the R packages should then just be a matter of typing the following into a terminal.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash line-numbers">tar -xzf tractor.tar.gz
cd tractor
make install
</code></pre>

<p>In most cases the installer will find R without any help, but if an error message reports &ldquo;command not found&rdquo; or similar, then please use <code>make install R=/path/to/R</code>, replacing <code>/path/to/R</code> with the actual path on your system. TractoR installs R packages into a library within its own directory structure, so it will not interfere with any other versions of those packages that you may have installed.</p>

<p>Unless you want to interact with TractoR exclusively through R (which is unlikely in most cases), you will also need to set up your environment so that you can use the <code>tractor</code> shell program and associated script files. To do this—assuming you use the bash shell—add the following lines to the <code>.bashrc</code> file in your home directory:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash line-numbers">export TRACTOR_HOME=/usr/local/tractor
export PATH=${TRACTOR_HOME}/bin:$PATH
export MANPATH=${TRACTOR_HOME}/share/man:$MANPATH
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, if you have unpacked the tarball somewhere other than <code>/usr/local/tractor</code>, you will need to alter the first line accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="installation-on-macos">Installation on macOS</h2>

<p>The simplest way to install TractoR on macOS is to use the <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> package manager, support for which was added in TractoR version 3.1.0. <strong>Note, however, that the CRAN build of R may not be compatible with Homebrew, so if you have already installed R from CRAN, it may be better to follow the instructions in the next paragraph.</strong> Once Homebrew itself is installed, the command</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">brew install tractor/tractor/tractor
</code></pre>

<p>should suffice to install R, TractoR and the necessary compilers. In this case the <code>TRACTOR_HOME</code> environment variable should generally be set to <code>/usr/local/opt/tractor</code>. Homebrew also makes it easy to update to new releases of R and TractoR later on.</p>

<p>The alternative is to install R from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/">CRAN</a>, in which case you may also need to obtain the compilers used for the CRAN build. Apple&rsquo;s own developer tools can be installed using the command</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">xcode-select --install
</code></pre>

<p>but at the time of writing this is not sufficient to build TractoR against R from CRAN. Either way, once R is installed, you should <a href="downloads.html">download the TractoR tarball</a>, uncompress it, run <code>make install</code> and set up the environment as described in the instructions for Linux above.</p>

<h2 id="installation-on-windows">Installation on Windows</h2>

<p>TractoR was developed for Unix-like systems, but installation and use on Windows is possible. If you are running Windows 10, the best route might be to install the recently introduced Windows Subsystem for Linux, and then install TractoR as if on Linux. Step-by-step instructions <a href="https://www.flakery.org/tractor-on-windows-experience-with-the-subsystem-for-linux/">are available for this route</a>.</p>

<p>The second option is to use the <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker containerisation system</a>. A Docker container for the TractoR minor version you want can be downloaded and launched using commands like</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash line-numbers">docker pull jonclayden/tractor:3.1
docker run -it --rm jonclayden/tractor:3.1
</code></pre>

<p>This will drop you into a <code>bash</code> shell in a Linux-based container with R and TractoR already installed and set up for you. You can consult <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/">Docker&rsquo;s documentation</a> for more information on giving the container access to your data.</p>

<p>The final and most heavyweight option is to run a full Linux distribution within a virtual machine environment such as <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> or <a href="http://www.vmware.com">VMware</a>, and then proceed as described above for Linux. FSL&rsquo;s developers <a href="https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation/Windows">provide a virtual machine image</a> which may be suitable.</p>

<h2 id="checking-your-installation">Checking your installation</h2>

<p>To check that the TractoR packages have been installed properly and TractoR scripts can be run successfully, you can run the set of tests included with TractoR 1.3.0 and later by typing</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">make clean test
</code></pre>

<p>Running these tests will typically take a few minutes, during which time you should see a series of messages confirming the success of each test, and the run time in each case. If any errors arise, something is probably wrong with your installation.</p>

<p>To test that the environment is set up correctly, try typing</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">tractor list
</code></pre>

<p>which should produce output similar to the following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash line-numbers">DICOM handling:
  age, dicomread, dicomsort, dicomtags

Image processing:
  binarise, components, morph, smooth, trim

General analysis:
  apply, extract, imageinfo, imagestats, mean, mkroi, reshape, values

Visualisation:
  slice, view

Registration:
  reg-apply, reg-check, reg-info, reg-linear, reg-nonlinear, reg-viz

  clone, import, status, transform

Diffusion processing:
  bedpost, dirviz, dpreproc, gradcheck, gradread, gradrotate, plotcorrections, 
tensorfit, track, trkinfo, trkmap

  deface, freesurf, parcellate

Heuristic neighbourhood tractography (deprecated):
  hnt-eval, hnt-interpret, hnt-ref, hnt-viz

Probabilistic neighbourhood tractography:
  pnt-data, pnt-em, pnt-eval, pnt-interpret, pnt-prune, pnt-ref, pnt-sample, 
pnt-train, pnt-viz

  graph-build, graph-decompose, graph-extract, graph-props, graph-reweight, 
graph-viz, graph2csv

Other scripts:
  chfiletype, compress, console, list, path, peek, platform, split, update

For information on a particular script, run "tractor -o &lt;script&gt;"
</code></pre>

<p>If instead you get an error from the shell saying that it couldn&rsquo;t find the <code>tractor</code> executable, or from <code>tractor</code> itself reporting the script file not found, the installation has not been completed correctly. Check that you have set up your environment as shown above, and make sure that you have started a new shell or sourced your <code>.bashrc</code> file to pick up the changes (<code>source ~/.bashrc</code>). Running the command <code>man tractor</code> should show the <code>tractor</code> man page.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>The <code>tractor</code> command line interface program is a wrapper which obviates the need to interact with R directly in order to use TractoR. Many common tasks, including neighbourhood tractography (see &ldquo;Next steps&rdquo; below), can be performed in this way through short R scripts which are stored within the TractoR home directory.</p>

<p>A full list of the scripts provided with the distribution can be obtained by typing <code>tractor list</code>, as shown above. Further information on a particular script, including a list of options that it supports, can be obtained using <code>tractor -o (script name)</code>. For more details on the usage of the <code>tractor</code> program, please see its man page (<code>man tractor</code>).</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>It is a good idea to read a little about TractoR&rsquo;s specific <a href="conventions.html">conventions</a>, which will make the rest of this documentation easier to follow. After that you may wish to explore TractoR&rsquo;s implementation of <a href="PNT-tutorial.html">&ldquo;neighbourhood tractography&rdquo;</a>, a robust and flexible method for consistent white matter tract segmentation in the brain.</p>
