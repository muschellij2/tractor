# Default strategy file for establishing transformations between spaces. Any
# or all of the elements of this file can be overridden by an equivalent
# file within a session directory, at session/transforms/strategy.yaml.
# Options have the following meanings.
#      affine: use affine registration
#   nonlinear: use nonlinear registration
#   symmetric: use symmetric nonlinear registration to allow for inverse
#              transformations (affine is implicitly symmetric)
#     reverse: use the reference image from the source space as the target
#              image, rather than the equivalent from the target space
#              (requires a symmetric registration)
#         fsl: prefer to use FSL-FLIRT for linear registration
#    niftyreg: prefer to use NiftyReg for linear registration

# Substantial distortion has been seen when nonlinearly warping diffusion data
# to MNI space, so an affine transformation is used for now
