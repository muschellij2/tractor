\title{Obtaining colour scales}
\usage{
getColourScale(n)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{A number, colour name or list (see Details).}
}
\value{
A list with elements
  \describe{
    \item{colours}{A character-mode vector representing the colours in the
      scale, usually of length 100. This can be passed as a colour scale to
      R's plotting functions.}
    \item{background}{A single character string representing the background
      colour.}
  }
}
\description{
The \code{getColourScale} function can be used to obtain a standard or
customised colour scale for use in the package's image visualisation
functions.
}
\details{
Colour scales can be specified in any of three ways. Firstly, by a single
number, representing a predefined colour scale. Currently valid values are 1
(greyscale, black background), 2 (red to yellow heat scale, red background),
3 (blue to red rainbow scale, blue background), 4 (blue to white to red
diverging scale, white background), 5 (white to red, white background), 6
(white to blue, white background), 7 (yellow to orange to red) and 8 (purple
to green to yellow, perceptually uniform). Secondly, a single colour name
can be given (see \code{\link{colours}}); in this case the background will
be black. This is useful for binary images. Thirdly, and most flexibly, a
list with two named elements can be given: \code{colours}, a vector of
colours representing the colour scale, perhaps created using using the
\code{shades} package; and \code{background}, a single colour representing
the background.
