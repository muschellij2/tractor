\title{Extract one or more elements from a list}
\usage{
indexList(list, index = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{list}{A list-like object, with a \code{[[} indexing method.}

\item{index}{A vector of integers or strings, or \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
If \code{index} is \code{NULL}, the whole list is returned.
  Otherwise, if \code{index} has length one, the corresponding element is
  extracted and returned. Otherwise a list containing the requested subset
  is returned.
}
\description{
Given a list-like first argument, this function extracts one or more of its
elements. Numeric and character indexing are allowed.
}
\note{
This function is not type-safe, in the sense that its return type
  depends on its arguments. It should therefore be used with care.
